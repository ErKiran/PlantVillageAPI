1,Apple,Apple Scab,"Apple scab is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis.It is common on susceptible apples and crabapples and causes leaves to yellow and drop prematurely in midsummer. In years with moist and cool spring weather, infection can cause widespread defoliation","The disease usually noticed on leaves and fruits.
Affected leaves become twisted or puckered and have black, circular spots on their upper surface.On the under surface of leaves, the spots are velvety and may coalesce to cover the whole leaf surface. 
Severely affected leaves may turn yellow and drop.
Scab can also infect flower stems and cause flowers to drop.
The lesions later become sunken and brown and may have spores around their marginsInfected fruit become distorted and may crack, allowing entry of secondary organisms.","Cultural Control:In affected orchards, new infections can be reduced by removing leaf litter and trimmings containing infected tissue from the orchard and incinerating them. This will reduce the amount of new ascospores released in the spring. Additionally, scab lesions on woody tissue can be excised from the tree if possible and similarly destroyed.
Chemical  Control:Chemical controls can include a variety of compounds. Benzimidazole fungicides, e.g., Benlate (now banned in many countries due to its containing the harmful chemical benzene) work well but resistance can arise quickly. A number of other chemical classes including sterol inhibitors such as Nova 40, and strobilurins such as Sovran are used extensively; however, some of these are slowly being phased out because of resistance problems."
2,Apple,Black Rot,"Black rot is a disease of apples that infects fruit, leaves and bark caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. It can also jump to healthy tissue on pear or quince trees, but is typically a secondary fungus of weak or dead tissues in other plants","Leaf symptoms first occur early in the spring when the leaves are unfolding.
They appear as small, purple specks on the upper surface of the leaves that enlarge into circular lesions 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3-6 mm) in diameter.
The margin of the lesions remains purple, while the center turns tan to brown. In a few weeks, secondary enlargement of these leaf spots occurs.
Heavily infected leaves become chlorotic and defoliation occurs.
As the rotted area enlarges, a series of concentric bands of uniform width form which alternate in color from black to brown. The flesh of the rotted area remains firm and leathery. Black pycnidia are often seen on the surface of the infected fruit.
Lesions resulting in canker formation usually are associated with a wound in the bark.","Cultural Control:During the winter, check for cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away 
the affectedlimbs at least six  inches beyond the wound.
Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection. 
Chemical Control:Genrral purpose fungicides like copper based spraysand lime sulfer can be used to control black rot .The main method of control is application of fungicides from silver tip through harvest. Apple cultivars do not vary greatly in their susceptibility to black rot fungus; however, 'Empire' and 'Cortland' may be slightly more susceptible than others."
3,Apple,Cedar Apple Rust,"Cedar-apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperivirginianae), cedar-hawthorn rust (G. globosum),and cedar-quince rust (G. clavipes) are closely related rust diseases that require two hosts to complete their life cycle. All three rusts can infect most varieties of eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) as well as many other junipers and an alternate host.","On apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. 
These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. 
Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.","Cultural Control:.As this fungus requires two host plants to complete its life cycle, removing one of the hosts can help prevent damage. Avoid planting juniper and rust-susceptible hosts in close proximity to each other.Use only resistant varieties in planting. Remove and replace diseased plants with resistant varieties.
Chemical Control:Use preventive fungicides labeled for use on apples. Fungicide sprays are aimed at protecting developing foliage from infection during the time the galls on the junipers are orange and gelatinous. This usually lasts for several weeks and fungicide applications are not necessary once the galls become dry and inactive. Pesticides registered for use include captan, chlorothalonil (Daconil), copper, mancozeb, maneb, sulfur, thiophanate methyl (Cleary 3336), thiram, triadimefon, and ziram."

an obligate biotrophic fungus","Initial symptoms, often occurring 7 to 10 days after the onset of the first irrigation,are light roughly-circular, powdery looking patches on young, susceptible leaves (newly unfolded, and light green expanding leaves).Older leaves develop an age-related (ontogenic) resistance to powdery mildew and are naturally more resistant to infection than younger leaves.","Remove diseased foliage from the plant and clean up fallen debris on the ground. Manage irrigation.In a typical dry spring, early irrigation may stimulate early cherry powdery mildew infections.
Apply sulfur or copper-based fungicides to prevent infection of susceptible plants. For best results, apply early or at first sign of disease. Spray all plant parts thoroughly and repeat at 7-10 day intervals up to the day of harvest.Effectively treat fungal diseases with SERENADE Garden.

8,Corn(Maize),Cercospora (Gray) leaf spot," Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina
( fungal pathogens ) ","Symptoms seen on corn include leaf lesions, discoloration (chlorosis), and foliar blight.
The initial symptoms of grey leaf spot emerge as small, dark, moist spots that are encircled by a thin, yellow radiance (lesions forming). The tissue within the “spot"" begins to die as spot size increases into longer, narrower leaf lesions. Although initially brownish and yellow, the characteristic grey color that follows is due to the production of grey fungal spores (conidia) on the lesion surface.","Poor airflow, low sunlight, overcrowding, improper soil nutrient and irrigation management, and poor soil drainage can all contribute to the propagation of the disease.
Management techniques include crop resistance, crop rotation, residue management, use of fungicides, and weed control. The purpose of disease management is to prevent the amount of secondary disease cycles as well as to protect leaf area from damage prior to grain formation.Fungicides, if sprayed early in season before initial damage, can be effective in reducing disease.
Currently there are 5 known fungicides that treat Corn grey leaf spot:
Headline EC (active ingredient: pyraclostrobin)
Quilt (active ingredient: azoxystrobin + propiconazole)
Proline 480 SC (active ingredient: prothioconazole)
Tilt 250 E, Bumper 418 EC (active ingredient: propiconazole)"
9,Corn(Maize),Common Rust ,fungus Puccinia sorghi,"Symptoms of common rust often appear after silking.
Small, round to elongate brown pustules form on both leaf surfaces and other above ground parts of the plant.
As the pustules mature they become brown to black.
If disease is severe, the leaves may yellow and die early.","Select rust-resistant plant varieties when available.
Pick off and destroy infected leaves and frequently rake under plants to remove all fallen debris.
If applied properly and in a timely manner, fungicide treatments can be effective in protecting corn leaves from foliar diseases."
10,Corn(Maize),Northen Leaf Blight ,Fungus Exserohilum turcicum," The most common diagnostic symptom of the disease on corn is cigar-shaped or elliptical necrotic gray-green lesions on the leaves that range from one to seven inches long.These lesions may first appear as narrow, tan streaks that run parallel to the leaf veins. Fully developed lesions typically have a sooty appearance during humid weather, as a result of spore (conidia) formation. As the disease progresses, the lesions grow together and create large areas of dead leaf tissue. The lesions found in Northern corn leaf blight are more acute if the leaves above the ear are infected during or soon after flowering of the plant.In susceptible corn hybrids, lesions are also found on the husk of ears or leaf sheaths.","Several ways to change cropping practices to control the disease include reducing the amount of infected residue left in a field, managing weeds to improve airflow and reduce humidity, or encouraging residue decomposition with tillage.
 The tillage will assist in breaking down crop debris and reducing existing inoculum.
 In a system with normal tillage, a one-year rotation out of corn can be effective, but a two-year rotation may be required for a reduced-tillage system.
 If possible, planting in low areas that receive heavy dew and fog should be avoided.
Selecting resistant hybrids; reducing corn residue by crop rotation, tillage, or stover harvest; and applying foliar fungicides are the primary means of controlling northern leaf blight.
Fungicide application may reduce yield losses, but economic return depends on hybrid resistance level, cropping history, tillage practices, location, corn price, yield potential and weather."

12,Grape,Black Rot,"ascomycetous fungus, Guignardia bidwellii","Relatively small, brown circular lesions develop on infected leaves and within a few days tiny black spherical fruiting bodies (pycnidia) protrude from them. Elongated black lesions on the petiole may eventually girdle these organs,causing the affected leaves to wilt.Shoot infection results in large black elliptical lesions. These lesions may contribute to breakage of shoots by wind, or in severe cases, may girdle and kill young shoots altogether.
Infection of the fruit is the most serious phase of the disease and may result in substantial economic loss. Infected berries first appear light or chocolate brown, but quickly turn darker brown, with masses of black pycnidia developing on the surface. Finally, infected berries shrivel and turn into hard black raisin-like bodies that are called mummies.","Cultural control consists of the management of the fields and sanitation methods to optimally grow grape crops.A proper pruning( horticultural and silvicultural practice involving the selective removal of certain parts of a plant, such as branches, buds, or roots) technique is another cultural control method to limit diseases.
The most common fungicides that prove to be excellent  for controlling black rot are Sovran 50WG, Flint 50WG, Abound Flowable (2.08F), and Pristine 38WDG. Some of these fungicides may only be available for commercial use, however homeowners may go to a hardware store or fungicide distributor for similar fungicides."
13,Grape,Esca(Black Measles),"Esca is caused by a complex of fungi that includes several species of Phaeoacremonium, primarily by P. aleophilum (currently known by the name of its sexual stage, Togninia minima), and by Phaeomoniella chlamydospora.","Foliar symptoms of esca first appear as chlorotic spots that subsequently coalesce, turning dark red in some red cultivarslike  Cabernet  ,  and  finally  becoming  necrotic.  Dead  tissues  appear  dark  brown  to  red-brown,  depending  on  the  cultivar .  Symptoms  often  extend  to  the  interveinal  areas  of  the  foliar  blade,  leaving  a  narrow  strip  of  unaffected  tissue  along  the  mainveins , thus giving the leaves a characteristic tiger-stripe pattern. 

","Delaying pruning to as late as possible in the dormant season (February or later) has been shown to be very effective in reducing the risk of infection. Delayed pruning takes advantage of reduced susceptibility of pruning wounds to infection and avoids the period of highest spore release during typically frequent rain events in December and January.In addition to the fungicides labeled as pruning-wound protectants, consider using alternative materials, such as a wound sealant with 5% boric acid in acrylic paint (Tech-Gro B-Lock), which is effective against Eutypa dieback and Esca, or an essential oil (Safecoat VitiSeal).

14,Grape,Leaf Blight(Cisariopsis Leaf Spot), It is caused by the bacterium Xylophilus ampelinus which survives in the vascular tissues of infected plants,On leaf surface we will see lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later. If disease is severe this lesions may coalesce. On berries we can see symptom similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse.,"Fungicides sprayed for other diseases in the season may help to reduce this disease.

16,Orange,Haunglongbing(Citrus Greening),"motile bacteria, Candidatus Liberibacter spp","HLB is distinguished by the common symptoms of yellowing of the veins and adjacent tissues; followed by splotchy mottling of the entire leaf, premature defoliation, dieback of twigs, decay of feeder rootlets and lateral roots, and decline in vigor, ultimately followed by the death of the entire plant.Affected trees have stunted growth, bear multiple off-season flowers (most of which fall off), and produce small, irregularly shaped fruit with a thick, pale peel that remains green at the bottom and tastes very bitter. Common symptoms can often be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies; however, the distinguishing factor between nutrient deficiencies is the pattern of symmetry. Nutrient deficiencies tend to be symmetrical along the leaf vein margin, while HLB has an asymmetrical yellowing around the vein. The most noticeable symptom of HLB is greening and stunting of the fruit, especially after ripening.","Cultural methods include antibacterial management, sanitation, removal of infected plants, frequent scouting, and most importantly, crisis declaration.
Tracking the disease will help prevent further infection in other affected areas and help mitigate more local infections if detected early enough.Certain antibiotics, specifically streptomycin and oxytetracycline, may be effective in the fight against citrus greening disease.

17,Peach,Bacterial Spot,"Bacterial spot, known also as bacteriosis, bacterial shothole, or shothole, is caused by the bacterium
Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni.","Numerous small spots form on the leaves. Thespots are angular, purple to purplish-brown or black.Spots may merge and the centers may fall out, givingthe characteristic “shothole” appearance. Heavilyinfected leaves turn yellow and drop. Severe leaf lossearly in the summer reduces fruit size and weakens thetree. A few lesions can result in severe defoliation onsensitive varieties; tolerant varieties may require manymore lesions for defoliation.
On fruits, tiny water-soaked, sunken spots form The spots enlarge and merge to cover large, irregularareas. As the fruit grows, cracking or pitting occurs inthe lesions. The brown rot fungus can easily enter thesecracks and become established. Every effort to controlbrown rot should be made when deep bacterial spots
form on fruits.","Bacterial spot is very difficult to control during rainy seasons. No entirely satisfactory control method is known.Chemical spray applications may provide some suppression of bacterial spot. Use dodine 65 WP plus Captan 50 WP (1/2 lb. plus 1 lb. per 100 gal. water).Observe label precautions, as this mixture can cause injury under certain conditions. Mycoshield at 12 oz. per 100 gal. is probably a more effective treatment. Mycoshield should be tank mixed with sulphur (6 lbs. per 100 gal.) or Captan (2 lb. per 100gal.) for broad spectrum disease control. Bacterialspot sprays should be initiated at shuck-split and repeated at seven-day intervals through cover sprays.Observe harvest restrictions.

19,Pepper Bell,Bacterial Spot,A pathovar of Pseudomonas syringae causal agent of bacterial leaf spot and blight of pepper transplants.,"Leaf spots that appear on the lower surface of older leaves as small, pimples and on the upper leaf surface as small water-soaked spots are a symptom of bacterial spot. This is an important pepper disease in Maryland. It also occasionally attacks tomatoes. Eventually, the spots develop gray to tan centers with darker borders. Lesions enlarge during warm, humid weather. Leaves may then turn yellow, then brown and drop. Lesions may also develop on stems. Fruits develop small, raised rough spots that do not affect eating quality. Severely infected leaves will drop resulting in sunscald of peppers. Bacterial leaf spot is spread by splashing rain and working with wet, infected plants. This disease can defoliate plants during wet weather. Hot, dry weather slows the spread of this disease. The disease can come in on seed or transplants and can overwinter in crop residue and soil.","Treat seeds by soaking them for 2 minutes in a 10% chlorine bleach solution (1 part bleach; 9 parts water). Thoroughly rinse seeds and dry them before planting.
Mulch plants deeply with a thick organic material like newspaper covered with straw or grass clippings.Avoid overhead watering.Remove and discard badly infected plant parts and all debris at the end of the season.Spray every 10-14 days with fixed copper (organic fungicide) to slow down the spread of infection.Rotate peppers to a different location if infections are severe and cover the soil with black plastic mulch or black landscape fabric prior to planting."

21,Potato,Early Blight ,"
Alternaria solani is a fungal pathogen, that produces a early blight  in  potato plant.
","In potato, primary damage by A. solani is attributed to premature defoliation of potato plants, which results in tuber yield reduction. Initial infection occurs on older leaves, with concentric dark brown spots developing mainly in the leaf center. The disease progresses during the period of potato vegetation, and infected leaves turn yellow and either dry out or fall off the stem. On stems, spots are gaunt with no clear contours (as compared to leaf spots). Tuber lesions are dry, dark and pressed into the tuber surface, with the underlying flesh turning dry, leathery and brown. During storage, tuber lesions may enlarge and tubers may become shriveled. Disease severity due to A. solani is highest when potato plants are injured, under stress or lack proper nutrition. High levels of nitrogen, moderate potassium and low phosphorus in the soil can reduce susceptibility of infection by the pathogen.","Cultural control:Clear infected debris from field to reduce inoculum for the next year.Water plants in the morning so plants are wet for the shortest amount of time.Use a drip irrigation system to minimize leaf wetness which provides optimal conditions for fungal growth.Use mulch so spores in soil cannot splash onto leaves from the soil.Rotate to a non-Solanaceous crop for at least three years.If possible control wild population of Solanaceae. This will decrease the amount of inoculum to infect your plants.Closely monitor field, especially in warm damp weather when it grows fastest, to reduce loss of crop and spray fungicide in time.Plant resistant cultivars.Increase air circulation in rows. Damp conditions allow for optimal growth of A. Solani and the disease spreads more rapidly. This can be achieved by planting farther apart or by trimming leaves.
Chemical control:There are numerous fungicides on the market for controlling early blight. Some of the fungicides on the market are (azoxystrobin), pyraclostrobin, Bacillus subtilis, chlorothalonil, copper products, hydrogen dioxide (Hydroperoxyl), mancozeb, potassium bicarbonate, and ziram.Specific spraying regiments are found on the label. Labels for these products should be read carefully before applying."
22,Potato,Late Blight,"Phytophthora infestans is a fungal pathogen, that produces a Late blight  in  potato plant.","Late blight of potato is identified by blackish/brown lesions on leaves and stems  that may be small at first and appear water-soaked or have chlorotic borders but expand rapidly and the entire leaf becomes become necrotic.
 In humid conditions, P. infestans produces sporangia and sporangiophores on the surface of infected tissue and the resulting white sporulation can be seen at the margins of lesions on abaxial (lower) surfaces of leaves . As many lesions accumulate, the entire plant can be destroyed in a matter of days after the first lesions are observed if the appropriate fungicide applications are not used.","Fungicides for the control of potato blight are normally only used in a preventative manner, optionally in conjunction with disease forecasting.In susceptible varieties, sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly. An early spray is most effective. The choice of fungicide can depend on the nature of local strains of P. infestans. Metalaxyl is a fungicide that was marketed for use against P. infestans, but suffered serious resistance issues when used on its own.To reduce the occurrence of resistance, it is strongly advised to use single-target fungicides such as metalaxyl along with carbamate compounds. A combination of other compounds are recommended for managing metalaxyl-resistant strains."

Podosphaera xanthii, infects all cucurbits, including muskmelons, squash, cucumbers, gourds, watermelons and pumpkins.","The first sign of powdery mildew is pale yellow leaf spots.White powdery spots can form on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, and quickly expand into large blotches. The large blotches can cover entire leaf, petiole and stem surfaces.When powdery mildew infects the majority of the foliage, the plant weakens and the fruit ripens prematurely.","Plant varieties with complete or partial resistance to powdery mildew.
Apply fertilizer based on soil test results. Avoid over-applying nitrogen.
Provide good air movement around plants through proper spacing, staking of plants and weed control.
Once a week, examine five mature leaves for powdery mildew infection. In large plantings, repeat at 10 different locations in the field.
If susceptible varieties are growing in an area where powdery mildew has resulted in yield loss in the past, fungicide may be necessary.
Apply fungicides after finding the first spot of powdery mildew.
Home gardeners can apply sulfur products to both the upper and lower surface of the leaves.
Commercial growers should refer to the Midwest Vegetable Production Guide for pesticide recommendations."
27,Strawberry,Leaf Scorch,"Leaf scorch is caused by the fungus Diplocarpon earlianum.
The leaf scorch fungus overwinters on infected leaves and leaf debris.
The fungus can remain dormant for long periods in dry leaves.
The fungus produces spores quickly in moist conditions.
Spores are spread by wind or by splashing water.","Leaf scorch symptoms are very similar to the early stages of common (Mycosphaerella) leaf spot, with irregular dark purple spots being scattered over the upper leaf surface. As the spots enlarge, they begin to look like drops of tar, and are actually the accumulations of black fruiting bodies (acervuli) of the fungus.The centers of the spots remain purple (in Mycosphaerella leaf spot they are white) and there is no well-defined lesion border. In heavy infections, these regions coalesce and the tissue between the lesions often takes on a purplish to bright red color that is dependent on cultivar, temperature, or other factors. The leaves eventually turn brown, dry up, and curl at the margins giving the leaf a scorched appearance. ","Cultural control:Choose planting sites with full sun, good soil drainage and air circulation. This fungus requires long periods of continuous wetness to infect plants, so any practice that promotes quick drying of leaves and fruit will reduce disease.
Irrigate through drip irrigation or a soaker hose. If overhead sprinkling is your only option, water early in the morning on a sunny day so leaves dry quickly after irrigation.
Remove weeds to improve air circulation around plants.
Plant in rows or narrow beds, no wider than 12-18 inches to promote good air movement in and around plants.
Apply nitrogen fertilizers after renovation. Avoid early spring applications of nitrogen which encourage overly lush growth. Lush growth reduces air flow promoting a moist microclimate which encourages the growth of leaf blight.
Chemical control:There are no fungicides available to home gardeners that effectively control strawberry leaf scorch.
Cultural practices usually keep this disease in check."

These leaf spots resemble concentric rings - a distinguishing characteristic of the pathogen - and measure up to 1.3 cm (0.51 inches) in diameter. 
Both the area around the leaf spot and the entire leaf may become yellow or chlorotic. Under favorable conditions (e.g., warm weather with short or abundant dews), significant defoliation of lower leaves may occur, leading to sunscald of the fruit.As the disease progresses, symptoms may migrate to the plant stem and fruit.","Cultural control:Clear infected debris from field to reduce inoculum for the next year.Water plants in the morning so plants are wet for the shortest amount of time.Use a drip irrigation system to minimize leaf wetness which provides optimal conditions for fungal growth.Use mulch so spores in soil cannot splash onto leaves from the soil.Rotate to a non-Solanaceous crop for at least three years.If possible control wild population of Solanaceae.

30,Tomato,Late Blight,Tomato late blight is caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans (P. infestans),"Once infected, late blight symptoms will become visible in three or four days. Small lesions appear on stems, leaves, or fruit. If the weather is damp and the temperature moderate – just like most rainy summer days – the pathogen would sporulate around these lesions and the late blight tomato disease will be ready to spread to the rest of the garden and beyond.
The tiny lesions of late tomato blight are hard to spot and sometimes go unnoticed. The late blight symptoms become more obvious when the area around the lesions appears water soaked or bruised and turns grey-green or yellowed. Each late tomato blight lesion can produce up to 300,000 sporangia a day and each of those sporangium are capable of forming a new lesion. Once begun, late blight tomato disease can sweep through acres in a matter of weeks. Plant foliage will be completely destroyed and the fruit will be ruined by dark, greasy looking blotches of necrotic flesh.

","Cultural control:Sanitation  is the first step in controlling tomato late blight. Clean up all debris and fallen fruit from the garden area. This is particularly essential in warmer areas where extended freezing is unlikely and the late blight tomato disease may overwinter in the fallen fruit.
Chemical control: Fungicides that contain maneb, mancozeb, chlorothanolil or fixed copper can help protect plants from late tomato blight. Repeated applications are necessary throughout the growing season as the disease can strike at any time. For organic gardeners, there are some fixed copper products approved for use; otherwise, all infected plants must be immediately removed and destroyed.

"
31,Tomato,Leaf Mold,"Cladosporium fulvum is an Ascomycete called Passalora fulva, a non-obligate
 pathogen that causes the disease on tomato known as the Tomato leaf mold.","Symptoms of tomato leaf mold appear usually with foliage, but fruit infection is rare. The primary symptom appear on the upper surface of infected leaves as a small spot pale green or yellowish with indefinite margins, and on corresponding area of the lower surface, the fungus begins to sporulate. The diagnostic symptom develops on lower surface as an olive green to grayish purple and velvety appearance, which are composed of spores (conidia). Continuously, the color of the infected leaf changes to yellowish brown and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop upon reaching a premature stage, and the defolication of the infected host will cause further infection. This disease develops well in relatively humidity levels (above 85%). When the temperature reaches optimum level for germinating, the host will be infected by the pathogen. Occasionally, this pathogen causes disease on the fruit or blossoms with various symptoms.[7] Fruits such as green and ripe one will develop dark rot on the stem. The blossoms will be killed before fruits grow.","Cultural Control:The first strategy of management is the cultural practices for reducing the disease. It includes adequating row and plant spacing that promote better air circulation through the canopy reducing the humidity; preventing excessive nitrogen on fertilization since nitrogen out of balance enhances foliage disease development; keeping the relatively humidity below 85% (suitable on greenhouse), promote air circulation inside the greenhouse, early planting might to reduce the disease severity and seed treatment with hot water (25 minutes at 122 °F or 50 °C).
Sanitation:The second strategy of management is the sanitization control in order to reduce the primary inoculum. Remove and destroy (burn) all plants debris after the harvest, scout for disease and rogue infected plants as soon as detected and steam sanitization the greenhouse between crops.
Resistance:The most effective and widespread method of disease control is to use resistant cultivars. However, only few resistant cultivar to tomato leaf mold are known such as Caruso, Capello, Cobra (race 5), Jumbo and Dombito (races 1 and 2). Moreover, this disease is not considered an important disease for breeding field tomatoes.
Chemical Control:The least but not the less important management is the chemical control that ensure good control of the disease. The chemical control is basically spraying fungicide as soon as the symptoms are evident. Compounds registered for using are: chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb and copper"
32,Tomato,Septoria Leaf Spot,"Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods.","Septoria leaf spot usually appears on the lower leaves after the first fruit sets. Spots are circular, about 1/16 to 1/4 inch in diameter with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers with small black fruiting structures. Characteristically, there are many spots per leaf. This disease spreads upwards from oldest to youngest growth. If leaf lesions are numerous, the leaves turn slightly yellow, then brown, and then wither. Fruit infection is rare.","Cultural control:Use disease-free seed. There's no evidence that it is carried by seeds, but err on the safe side and don't save seed from infected plants. Thoroughly processing the tomato seeds you are saving will also help rid the seeds of lingering diseases.
Start with a clean garden. Dispose of all affected plants. The fungus does not remain in the soil, but it can over-winter on the debris of diseased plants. So it's important to dispose of all the affected plants far away from the garden and the compost pile. Keep in mind that it may have spread to your potatoes and eggplants, too.
Avoid overhead watering. Water aids the spread of Septoria leaf spot. Keep it off the leaves as much as possible by watering at the base of the plant only. Of course, it's impossible to keep the rain off your plants, but every little bit helps.
Chemical Control:Consider organic fungicide options. Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued managemen"
33,Tomato,Spider Mites Two Spotted Spider Mite,"The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops . Spider mites can occur in tomato, eggplant, potato, vine crops such as melons, cucumbers, and other crops. Two-spotted spider mites are one of the most important pests of eggplant.","Feeding injury often gives the top leaf surfaces a mottled or speckled, dull appearance. Leaves then turn yellow and drop. Large populations produce visible webbing that can completely cover the leaves.
In the field, spider mites are favored by hot dry weather, which also aggravates injury by stressing the plant. Damage is often underestimated since the wounds and the pest are not apparent to our eyes without close inspection. Leaves become blotched with pale yellow, reddish brown spots ranging from small to large areas on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Other symptoms caused by either severe or constant attack include distorted leaves, overall loss of plant vigor (in spite of adequate moisture and nutrition), whitening or spotting of leaves, yellowing of the plant or some of the leaves, and in some cases loss of foliage and death","Cultural Control:Avoid weedy fields and do not plant eggplant adjacent to legume forage crops.Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.Do not over-fertilize.Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.
Biological Controls:Preventative releases of the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, may suppress TSSM populations in greenhousese and vegetable fields, as they do in strawberry fields. Amblyseius fallicis is a predatory mite that is widely used in greenhouses.
 Chemical Controls & Pesticides:For control, use selective products whenever possible. Selective products which have worked well in the field include:
bifenazate (Acramite): Group UN, a long residual nerve poison
abamectin (Agri-Mek): Group 6, derived from a soil bacterium
spirotetramat (Movento): Group 23, mainly affects immature stages"
34,Tomato,Target Spot,"Target spot of tomato caused by Corynespora cassiicola, is a serious foliar disease of both greenhouse and field grown tomatoes. The field disease is limited to the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The pathogen is identified primarily by the occurrence of indeterminate conidiophores with apically budding, multiple pseudoseptate conidia. ","The disease starts on the older leaves and spreads upwards. The first signs are irregular-shaped spots (less than 1 mm) with a yellow margin . Some of the spots enlarge up to 10 mm and show characteristics rings, hence the name of ""target spot"" . Spread to all leaflets and to other leaves is rapid , causing the leaves to turn yellow, collapse and die . Spots also occur on the stems. They are long and thin. Small light brown spots with dark margins may also occur on the fruit.
The spores are spread by wind-blown rain, and if windy wet weather continues for a few days, spread is fast and plants lose their leaves quickly.","Cultural Control:Cultural control is important. The following should be done:
Before planting:Do not plant new crops next to older ones that have the disease.
Plant as far as possible from papaya, especially if leaves have small angular spots (Photo 5).
Check all seedlings in the nursery, and throw away any with leaf spots.
During growth:Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base
Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.
Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.
After harvest:Collect and burn as much of the crop as possible when the harvest is complete.
Practise crop rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land.
Chemical Control:Warm wet conditions favour the disease such that fungicides are needed to give adequate control. The products to use are chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride or mancozeb. Treatment should start when the first spots are seen and continue at 10-14-day intervals until 3-4 weeks before last harvest. It is important to spray both sides of the leaves."
35,Tomato,Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a DNA virus from the genus Begomovirus and the family Geminiviridae. TYLCV causes the most destructive disease of tomato, and it can be found in tropical and subtropical regions causing severe economic losses. This virus is transmitted by an insect vector from the family Aleyrodidae and order Hemiptera, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, commonly known as the silverleaf whitefly or the sweet potato whitefly.","Plants are severely stunted with shoots becoming erect.Leaflets are reduced in size and pucker. Leaflets curlupwards, become distorted, and have prominent yellowing along margins and/or interveinal regions.Flowers wither.Plants will set very few fruit after infection occurs;therefore any plants infected before flowering stage will produce extremely low yields. The appearance of thefruit is unaffected.","Cultural Control:Plant new tomato crops in isolated fields. If feasible,plant a tall border crop, such as maize, around the tomato crop. Use mulches of straw, yellow plastic or UV-reflective material to reduce landing of whiteflies.
Inter-planting of tomato with ‘bait’ plants such as cucumber may be useful for control of this virus but other viruses such as CMV may increase in importance.The ‘bait’ plants are then sprayed with an insecticide
Chemical control :  It include the application of systemic insecticides as soil drenches or regular sprays during the seedling stage to reduce the population of the whitefly vector. A second application may be necessary to control adults that have emerged from the egg and nymph stage since the application ofthe first spray. Rotation of insecticides may be necessary to prevent the development of resistance in the vector. However, chemical control may not beeffective in areas where disease incidence is high."
36,Tomato,Tomtato Mosaic Virus,Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a plant pathogenic virus. It is found worldwide and affects tomatoes and many other plants.,"The foliage of affected tomato plants shows mottling, with alternating yellowish and darker green areas, the latter often appearing thicker and raised giving a blister-like appearance. The leaves tend to be fern-like in appearance with pointed tips and younger leaves may be twisted. The fruit may be distorted, yellow blotches and necrotic spots may occur on both ripe and green fruit and there may be internal browning of the fruit wall. In young plants, the infection reduces the set of fruit and may cause distortions and blemishes. The entire plant may be dwarfed and the flowers discoloured.Environmental conditions influence the symptoms. These include temperature, day length and light intensity as well as the variety, the age of the plant at infection and the virulence of the strain of ToMV.","The only treatment is prevention. No chemical products are available to cure or protect plants. The best factor in controlling and reducing infection is to practice sanitation. Remove any infected plants, including the roots. Remove Also, discard any plants near those affected.

Wash hands with milk or soap and water as this can reduce the risk of contamination by over 90%. A gardener that has been in contact with tobacco products absolutely must do this. The coat of the mosaic virus reacts with proteins in milk, so milk can be used to inactivate the virus.

Avoid planting in a field where infected tomato plants were grown. Gardening tools, pots, and planters need to be sterilized and washed regularly. A milk solution of 5 gallons of milk to 100 gallons of water or soap and water may be used. Steam or commercial disinfectants may also be used for disinfection. Use disease resistant tomato seeds. Starter plants will have certain codes on the name tag indicated with a “T” for resistance to this virus."
