        "DISEASE": "Apple Scab",
        "CAUSAL AGENT": "Apple scab is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis.It is common on susceptible apples and crabapples and causes leaves to yellow and drop prematurely in midsummer. In years with moist and cool spring weather, infection can cause widespread defoliation",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "The disease usually noticed on leaves and fruits.\nAffected leaves become twisted or puckered and have black, circular spots on their upper surface.On the under surface of leaves, the spots are velvety and may coalesce to cover the whole leaf surface. \nSeverely affected leaves may turn yellow and drop.\nScab can also infect flower stems and cause flowers to drop.\nThe lesions later become sunken and brown and may have spores around their marginsInfected fruit become distorted and may crack, allowing entry of secondary organisms.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural Control:In affected orchards, new infections can be reduced by removing leaf litter and trimmings containing infected tissue from the orchard and incinerating them. This will reduce the amount of new ascospores released in the spring. Additionally, scab lesions on woody tissue can be excised from the tree if possible and similarly destroyed.\nChemical  Control:Chemical controls can include a variety of compounds. Benzimidazole fungicides, e.g., Benlate (now banned in many countries due to its containing the harmful chemical benzene) work well but resistance can arise quickly. A number of other chemical classes including sterol inhibitors such as Nova 40, and strobilurins such as Sovran are used extensively; however, some of these are slowly being phased out because of resistance problems."

        "CAUSAL AGENT": "Black rot is a disease of apples that infects fruit, leaves and bark caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. It can also jump to healthy tissue on pear or quince trees, but is typically a secondary fungus of weak or dead tissues in other plants",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "Leaf symptoms first occur early in the spring when the leaves are unfolding.\nThey appear as small, purple specks on the upper surface of the leaves that enlarge into circular lesions 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3-6 mm) in diameter.\nThe margin of the lesions remains purple, while the center turns tan to brown. In a few weeks, secondary enlargement of these leaf spots occurs.\nHeavily infected leaves become chlorotic and defoliation occurs.\nAs the rotted area enlarges, a series of concentric bands of uniform width form which alternate in color from black to brown. The flesh of the rotted area remains firm and leathery. Black pycnidia are often seen on the surface of the infected fruit.\nLesions resulting in canker formation usually are associated with a wound in the bark.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural Control:During the winter, check for cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away \nthe affectedlimbs at least six  inches beyond the wound.\nDestroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection. \nChemical Control:Genrral purpose fungicides like copper based spraysand lime sulfer can be used to control black rot .The main method of control is application of fungicides from silver tip through harvest. Apple cultivars do not vary greatly in their susceptibility to black rot fungus; however, 'Empire' and 'Cortland' may be slightly more susceptible than others."

        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "On apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. \nThese gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. \nOrange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural Control:.As this fungus requires two host plants to complete its life cycle, removing one of the hosts can help prevent damage. Avoid planting juniper and rust-susceptible hosts in close proximity to each other.Use only resistant varieties in planting. Remove and replace diseased plants with resistant varieties.\nChemical Control:Use preventive fungicides labeled for use on apples. Fungicide sprays are aimed at protecting developing foliage from infection during the time the galls on the junipers are orange and gelatinous. This usually lasts for several weeks and fungicide applications are not necessary once the galls become dry and inactive. Pesticides registered for use include captan, chlorothalonil (Daconil), copper, mancozeb, maneb, sulfur, thiophanate methyl (Cleary 3336), thiram, triadimefon, and ziram."

        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "The most common diagnostic symptom of the disease on corn is cigar-shaped or elliptical necrotic gray-green lesions on the leaves that range from one to seven inches long.These lesions may first appear as narrow, tan streaks that run parallel to the leaf veins. Fully developed lesions typically have a sooty appearance during humid weather, as a result of spore (conidia) formation. As the disease progresses, the lesions grow together and create large areas of dead leaf tissue. The lesions found in Northern corn leaf blight are more acute if the leaves above the ear are infected during or soon after flowering of the plant.In susceptible corn hybrids, lesions are also found on the husk of ears or leaf sheaths.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Several ways to change cropping practices to control the disease include reducing the amount of infected residue left in a field, managing weeds to improve airflow and reduce humidity, or encouraging residue decomposition with tillage.\n The tillage will assist in breaking down crop debris and reducing existing inoculum.\n In a system with normal tillage, a one-year rotation out of corn can be effective, but a two-year rotation may be required for a reduced-tillage system.\n If possible, planting in low areas that receive heavy dew and fog should be avoided.\nSelecting resistant hybrids; reducing corn residue by crop rotation, tillage, or stover harvest; and applying foliar fungicides are the primary means of controlling northern leaf blight.\nFungicide application may reduce yield losses, but economic return depends on hybrid resistance level, cropping history, tillage practices, location, corn price, yield potential and weather."

Elongated black lesions on the petiole may eventually girdle these organs,causing the affected leaves to wilt.Shoot infection results in large black elliptical lesions. These lesions may contribute to breakage of shoots by wind, or in severe cases, may girdle and kill young shoots altogether.\nInfection of the fruit is the most serious phase of the disease and may result in substantial economic loss. Infected berries first appear light or chocolate brown, but quickly turn darker brown, with masses of black pycnidia developing on the surface. Finally, infected berries shrivel and turn into hard black raisin-like bodies that are called mummies.",

        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Delaying pruning to as late as possible in the dormant season (February or later) has been shown to be very effective in reducing the risk of infection. Delayed pruning takes advantage of reduced susceptibility of pruning wounds to infection and avoids the period of highest spore release during typically frequent rain events in December and January.In addition to the fungicides labeled as pruning-wound protectants, consider using alternative materials, such as a wound sealant with 5% boric acid in acrylic paint (Tech-Gro B-Lock), which is effective against Eutypa dieback and Esca, or an essential oil (Safecoat VitiSeal)."

Common symptoms can often be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies; however, the distinguishing factor between nutrient deficiencies is the pattern of symmetry. Nutrient deficiencies tend to be symmetrical along the leaf vein margin, while HLB has an asymmetrical yellowing around the vein.

        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "In potato, primary damage by A. solani is attributed to premature defoliation of potato plants, which results in tuber yield reduction. Initial infection occurs on older leaves, with concentric dark brown spots developing mainly in the leaf center. The disease progresses during the period of potato vegetation, and infected leaves turn yellow and either dry out or fall off the stem. On stems, spots are gaunt with no clear contours (as compared to leaf spots). Tuber lesions are dry, dark and pressed into the tuber surface, with the underlying flesh turning dry, leathery and brown. During storage, tuber lesions may enlarge and tubers may become shriveled. Disease severity due to A. solani is highest when potato plants are injured, under stress or lack proper nutrition. High levels of nitrogen, moderate potassium and low phosphorus in the soil can reduce susceptibility of infection by the pathogen.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural control:Clear infected debris from field to reduce inoculum for the next year.Water plants in the morning so plants are wet for the shortest amount of time.Use a drip irrigation system to minimize leaf wetness which provides optimal conditions for fungal growth.Use mulch so spores in soil cannot splash onto leaves from the soil.Rotate to a non-Solanaceous crop for at least three years.If possible control wild population of Solanaceae. This will decrease the amount of inoculum to infect your plants.Closely monitor field, especially in warm damp weather when it grows fastest, to reduce loss of crop and spray fungicide in time.Plant resistant cultivars.Increase air circulation in rows. Damp conditions allow for optimal growth of A. Solani and the disease spreads more rapidly. This can be achieved by planting farther apart or by trimming leaves.\nChemical control:There are numerous fungicides on the market for controlling early blight. Some of the fungicides on the market are (azoxystrobin), pyraclostrobin, Bacillus subtilis, chlorothalonil, copper products, hydrogen dioxide (Hydroperoxyl), mancozeb, potassium bicarbonate, and ziram.Specific spraying regiments are found on the label.

As many lesions accumulate, the entire plant can be destroyed in a matter of days after the first lesions are observed if the appropriate fungicide applications are not used.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Fungicides for the control of potato blight are normally only used in a preventative manner, optionally in conjunction with disease forecasting.In susceptible varieties, sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly. An early spray is most effective. The choice of fungicide can depend on the nature of local strains of P. infestans. Metalaxyl is a fungicide that was marketed for use against P. infestans, but suffered serious resistance issues when used on its own.To reduce the occurrence of resistance, it is strongly advised to use single-target fungicides such as metalaxyl along with carbamate compounds.

This fungus requires long periods of continuous wetness to infect plants, so any practice that promotes quick drying of leaves and fruit will reduce disease.\nIrrigate through drip irrigation or a soaker hose. If overhead sprinkling is your only option, water early in the morning on a sunny day so leaves dry quickly after irrigation.\nRemove weeds to improve air circulation around plants.\nPlant in rows or narrow beds, no wider than 12-18 inches to promote good air movement in and around plants.\nApply nitrogen fertilizers after renovation. Avoid early spring applications of nitrogen which encourage overly lush growth. Lush growth reduces air flow promoting a moist microclimate which encourages the growth of leaf blight.\nChemical control:There are no fungicides available to home gardeners that effectively control strawberry leaf scorch.\nCultural practices usually keep this disease in check."

        "DISEASE": "Early Blight",
        "CAUSAL AGENT": "Alternaria solani is a fungal pathogen, that produces a early blight  in  tomato plant.",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "On tomato, foliar symptoms of A. solani generally occur on the oldest leaves and start as small lesions that are brown to black in color. \nThese leaf spots resemble concentric rings - a distinguishing characteristic of the pathogen - and measure up to 1.3 cm (0.51 inches) in diameter. \nBoth the area around the leaf spot and the entire leaf may become yellow or chlorotic. Under favorable conditions (e.g., warm weather with short or abundant dews), significant defoliation of lower leaves may occur, leading to sunscald of the fruit.As the disease progresses, symptoms may migrate to the plant stem and fruit.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural control:Clear infected debris from field to reduce inoculum for the next year.Water plants in the morning so plants are wet for the shortest amount of time.Use a drip irrigation system to minimize leaf wetness which provides optimal conditions for fungal growth.Use mulch so spores in soil cannot splash onto leaves from the soil.Rotate to a non-Solanaceous crop for at least three years.If possible control wild population of Solanaceae. This will decrease the amount of inoculum to infect your plants.Closely monitor field, especially in warm damp weather when it grows fastest, to reduce loss of crop and spray fungicide in time.Plant resistant cultivars.Increase air circulation in rows. Damp conditions allow for optimal growth of A. Solani and the disease spreads more rapidly. This can be achieved by planting farther apart or by trimming leaves.\nChemical control:There are numerous fungicides on the market for controlling early blight. Some of the fungicides on the market are (azoxystrobin), pyraclostrobin, Bacillus subtilis, chlorothalonil, copper products, hydrogen dioxide (Hydroperoxyl), mancozeb, potassium bicarbonate, and ziram.Specific spraying regiments are found on the label. Labels for these products should be read carefully before applying."

        "DISEASE": "Late Blight",
        "CAUSAL AGENT": "Tomato late blight is caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans (P. infestans)",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "Once infected, late blight symptoms will become visible in three or four days. Small lesions appear on stems, leaves, or fruit. If the weather is damp and the temperature moderate – just like most rainy summer days – the pathogen would sporulate around these lesions and the late blight tomato disease will be ready to spread to the rest of the garden and beyond.\nThe tiny lesions of late tomato blight are hard to spot and sometimes go unnoticed. The late blight symptoms become more obvious when the area around the lesions appears water soaked or bruised and turns grey-green or yellowed. Each late tomato blight lesion can produce up to 300,000 sporangia a day and each of those sporangium are capable of forming a new lesion. Once begun, late blight tomato disease can sweep through acres in a matter of weeks. Plant foliage will be completely destroyed and the fruit will be ruined by dark, greasy looking blotches of necrotic flesh.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural control:Sanitation  is the first step in controlling tomato late blight. Clean up all debris and fallen fruit from the garden area. This is particularly essential in warmer areas where extended freezing is unlikely and the late blight tomato disease may overwinter in the fallen fruit.\nChemical control: Fungicides that contain maneb, mancozeb, chlorothanolil or fixed copper can help protect plants from late tomato blight. Repeated applications are necessary throughout the growing season as the disease can strike at any time. For organic gardeners, there are some fixed copper products approved for use; otherwise, all infected plants must be immediately removed and destroyed."

        "DISEASE": "Leaf Mold",
        "CAUSAL AGENT": "Cladosporium fulvum is an Ascomycete called Passalora fulva, a non-obligate\n pathogen that causes the disease on tomato known as the Tomato leaf mold.",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "Symptoms of tomato leaf mold appear usually with foliage, but fruit infection is rare. The primary symptom appear on the upper surface of infected leaves as a small spot pale green or yellowish with indefinite margins, and on corresponding area of the lower surface, the fungus begins to sporulate. The diagnostic symptom develops on lower surface as an olive green to grayish purple and velvety appearance, which are composed of spores (conidia). Continuously, the color of the infected leaf changes to yellowish brown and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop upon reaching a premature stage, and the defolication of the infected host will cause further infection. This disease develops well in relatively humidity levels (above 85%). When the temperature reaches optimum level for germinating, the host will be infected by the pathogen. Occasionally, this pathogen causes disease on the fruit or blossoms with various symptoms.[7] Fruits such as green and ripe one will develop dark rot on the stem. The blossoms will be killed before fruits grow.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural Control:The first strategy of management is the cultural practices for reducing the disease. It includes adequating row and plant spacing that promote better air circulation through the canopy reducing the humidity; preventing excessive nitrogen on fertilization since nitrogen out of balance enhances foliage disease development; keeping the relatively humidity below 85% (suitable on greenhouse), promote air circulation inside the greenhouse, early planting might to reduce the disease severity and seed treatment with hot water (25 minutes at 122 °F or 50 °C).\nSanitation:The second strategy of management is the sanitization control in order to reduce the primary inoculum. Remove and destroy (burn) all plants debris after the harvest, scout for disease and rogue infected plants as soon as detected and steam sanitization the greenhouse between crops.\nResistance:The most effective and widespread method of disease control is to use resistant cultivars. However, only few resistant cultivar to tomato leaf mold are known such as Caruso, Capello, Cobra (race 5), Jumbo and Dombito (races 1 and 2). Moreover, this disease is not considered an important disease for breeding field tomatoes.\nChemical Control:The least but not the less important management is the chemical control that ensure good control of the disease. The chemical control is basically spraying fungicide as soon as the symptoms are evident. Compounds registered for using are: chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb and copper"

        "DISEASE": "Septoria Leaf Spot",
        "CAUSAL AGENT": "Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods.",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "Septoria leaf spot usually appears on the lower leaves after the first fruit sets. Spots are circular, about 1/16 to 1/4 inch in diameter with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers with small black fruiting structures. Characteristically, there are many spots per leaf. This disease spreads upwards from oldest to youngest growth. If leaf lesions are numerous, the leaves turn slightly yellow, then brown, and then wither. Fruit infection is rare.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural control:Use disease-free seed. There's no evidence that it is carried by seeds, but err on the safe side and don't save seed from infected plants. Thoroughly processing the tomato seeds you are saving will also help rid the seeds of lingering diseases.\nStart with a clean garden. Dispose of all affected plants. The fungus does not remain in the soil, but it can over-winter on the debris of diseased plants. So it's important to dispose of all the affected plants far away from the garden and the compost pile. Keep in mind that it may have spread to your potatoes and eggplants, too.\nAvoid overhead watering. Water aids the spread of Septoria leaf spot. Keep it off the leaves as much as possible by watering at the base of the plant only. Of course, it's impossible to keep the rain off your plants, but every little bit helps.\nChemical Control:Consider organic fungicide options. Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued managemen"

        "DISEASE": "Spider Mites Two Spotted Spider Mite",
        "CAUSAL AGENT": "The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops . Spider mites can occur in tomato, eggplant, potato, vine crops such as melons, cucumbers, and other crops. Two-spotted spider mites are one of the most important pests of eggplant.",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "Feeding injury often gives the top leaf surfaces a mottled or speckled, dull appearance. Leaves then turn yellow and drop. Large populations produce visible webbing that can completely cover the leaves.\nIn the field, spider mites are favored by hot dry weather, which also aggravates injury by stressing the plant. Damage is often underestimated since the wounds and the pest are not apparent to our eyes without close inspection. Leaves become blotched with pale yellow, reddish brown spots ranging from small to large areas on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Other symptoms caused by either severe or constant attack include distorted leaves, overall loss of plant vigor (in spite of adequate moisture and nutrition), whitening or spotting of leaves, yellowing of the plant or some of the leaves, and in some cases loss of foliage and death",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural Control:Avoid weedy fields and do not plant eggplant adjacent to legume forage crops.Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.Do not over-fertilize.Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.\nBiological Controls:Preventative releases of the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, may suppress TSSM populations in greenhousese and vegetable fields, as they do in strawberry fields. Amblyseius fallicis is a predatory mite that is widely used in greenhouses.\n Chemical Controls & Pesticides:For control, use selective products whenever possible. Selective products which have worked well in the field include:\nbifenazate (Acramite): Group UN, a long residual nerve poison\nabamectin (Agri-Mek): Group 6, derived from a soil bacterium\nspirotetramat (Movento): Group 23, mainly affects immature stages"

        "DISEASE": "Target Spot",
        "CAUSAL AGENT": "Target spot of tomato caused by Corynespora cassiicola, is a serious foliar disease of both greenhouse and field grown tomatoes. The field disease is limited to the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The pathogen is identified primarily by the occurrence of indeterminate conidiophores with apically budding, multiple pseudoseptate conidia.",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "The disease starts on the older leaves and spreads upwards. The first signs are irregular-shaped spots (less than 1 mm) with a yellow margin . Some of the spots enlarge up to 10 mm and show characteristics rings, hence the name of \"target spot\" . Spread to all leaflets and to other leaves is rapid , causing the leaves to turn yellow, collapse and die . Spots also occur on the stems. They are long and thin. Small light brown spots with dark margins may also occur on the fruit.\nThe spores are spread by wind-blown rain, and if windy wet weather continues for a few days, spread is fast and plants lose their leaves quickly.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural Control:Cultural control is important. The following should be done:\nBefore planting:Do not plant new crops next to older ones that have the disease.\nPlant as far as possible from papaya, especially if leaves have small angular spots (Photo 5).\nCheck all seedlings in the nursery, and throw away any with leaf spots.\nDuring growth:Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base\nRemove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.\nKeep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.\nDo not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.\nAfter harvest:Collect and burn as much of the crop as possible when the harvest is complete.\nPractise crop rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land.\nChemical Control:Warm wet conditions favour the disease such that fungicides are needed to give adequate control. The products to use are chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride or mancozeb. Treatment should start when the first spots are seen and continue at 10-14-day intervals until 3-4 weeks before last harvest. It is important to spray both sides of the leaves."

        "CAUSAL AGENT": "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a DNA virus from the genus Begomovirus and the family Geminiviridae. TYLCV causes the most destructive disease of tomato, and it can be found in tropical and subtropical regions causing severe economic losses. This virus is transmitted by an insect vector from the family Aleyrodidae and order Hemiptera, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, commonly known as the silverleaf whitefly or the sweet potato whitefly.",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "Plants are severely stunted with shoots becoming erect.Leaflets are reduced in size and pucker. Leaflets curlupwards, become distorted, and have prominent yellowing along margins and/or interveinal regions.Flowers wither.Plants will set very few fruit after infection occurs;therefore any plants infected before flowering stage will produce extremely low yields. The appearance of thefruit is unaffected.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "Cultural Control:Plant new tomato crops in isolated fields. If feasible,plant a tall border crop, such as maize, around the tomato crop. Use mulches of straw, yellow plastic or UV-reflective material to reduce landing of whiteflies.\nInter-planting of tomato with ‘bait’ plants such as cucumber may be useful for control of this virus but other viruses such as CMV may increase in importance.The ‘bait’ plants are then sprayed with an insecticide\nChemical control :  It include the application of systemic insecticides as soil drenches or regular sprays during the seedling stage to reduce the population of the whitefly vector. A second application may be necessary to control adults that have emerged from the egg and nymph stage since the application ofthe first spray. Rotation of insecticides may be necessary to prevent the development of resistance in the vector. However, chemical control may not beeffective in areas where disease incidence is high."

        "DISEASE": "Tomtato Mosaic Virus",
        "CAUSAL AGENT": "Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a plant pathogenic virus. It is found worldwide and affects tomatoes and many other plants.",
        "EFFECT/SYMPTOMS": "The foliage of affected tomato plants shows mottling, with alternating yellowish and darker green areas, the latter often appearing thicker and raised giving a blister-like appearance. The leaves tend to be fern-like in appearance with pointed tips and younger leaves may be twisted. The fruit may be distorted, yellow blotches and necrotic spots may occur on both ripe and green fruit and there may be internal browning of the fruit wall. In young plants, the infection reduces the set of fruit and may cause distortions and blemishes. The entire plant may be dwarfed and the flowers discoloured.Environmental conditions influence the symptoms. These include temperature, day length and light intensity as well as the variety, the age of the plant at infection and the virulence of the strain of ToMV.",
        "CONTROL MEASURES": "The only treatment is prevention. No chemical products are available to cure or protect plants. The best factor in controlling and reducing infection is to practice sanitation. Remove any infected plants, including the roots. Remove Also, discard any plants near those affected.\n\nWash hands with milk or soap and water as this can reduce the risk of contamination by over 90%. A gardener that has been in contact with tobacco products absolutely must do this. The coat of the mosaic virus reacts with proteins in milk, so milk can be used to inactivate the virus.\n\nAvoid planting in a field where infected tomato plants were grown. Gardening tools, pots, and planters need to be sterilized and washed regularly. A milk solution of 5 gallons of milk to 100 gallons of water or soap and water may be used. Steam or commercial disinfectants may also be used for disinfection. Use disease resistant tomato seeds. Starter plants will have certain codes on the name tag indicated with a “T” for resistance to this virus."
