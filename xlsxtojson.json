In a few weeks, secondary enlargement of these leaf spots occurs.\r\nHeavily infected leaves become chlorotic and defoliation occurs.\r\nAs the rotted area enlarges, a series of concentric bands of uniform width form which alternate in color from black to brown. The flesh of the rotted area remains firm and leathery. Black pycnidia are often seen on the surface of the infected fruit.\r\nLesions resulting in canker formation usually are associated with a wound in the bark.","__EMPTY_4":"During the winter, check for cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away \r\nthe affectedlimbs at least six  inches beyond the wound.\r\nDestroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection. \r\nGenrral purpose fungicides like copper based spraysand lime sulfer can be used to control black rot ."},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"3","__EMPTY":"Apple","__EMPTY_1":"Cedar Apple Rust","__EMPTY_2":"Fungus Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae","__EMPTY_3":"On apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. \r\nThese gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. \r\nOrange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.","__EMPTY_4":"Apple and crab apple trees can be protected from the spores produced by the junipers by applying fungicides.\r\nThe spores are produced in spring, which is why organic fungicides can be applied weekly on apple and crabapple trees from the time the buds begin to form. \r\nThe release of spores only occurs during the spring, which is why fungicides don't need to be applied after spring.\r\n More often than not, the fungicide includes chlorothalonil, mancozeb, propiconazole, sulfur, myclobutanil, or copper soap.\r\nAs this fungus requires two host plants to complete its life cycle, removing one of the hosts can help prevent damage."},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"4","__EMPTY":"Apple","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"5","__EMPTY":"Blueberry","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"6","__EMPTY":"Cherry(Including sour)","__EMPTY_1":"Powdery Mildew"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"7","__EMPTY":"Cherry(Including sour)","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"8","__EMPTY":"Corn(Maize)","__EMPTY_1":"Cercospora (Gray) leaf spot"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"9","__EMPTY":"Corn(Maize)","__EMPTY_1":"Common Rust "},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"10","__EMPTY":"Corn(Maize)","__EMPTY_1":"Northen Leaf Blight "},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"11","__EMPTY":"Corn(Maize)","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"12","__EMPTY":"Grape","__EMPTY_1":"Black Rot"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"13","__EMPTY":"Grape","__EMPTY_1":"Esca(Black Measles)"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"14","__EMPTY":"Grape","__EMPTY_1":"Leaf Blight(Cisariopsis Leaf Spot)"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"15","__EMPTY":"Grape","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"16","__EMPTY":"Orange","__EMPTY_1":"Haunglongbing(Citrus Greening)"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"17","__EMPTY":"Peach","__EMPTY_1":"Bacterial Spot"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"18","__EMPTY":"Peach","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"19","__EMPTY":"Pepper Bell","__EMPTY_1":"Bacterial Spot"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"20","__EMPTY":"Pepper Bell","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"21","__EMPTY":"Potato","__EMPTY_1":"Early Blight "},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"22","__EMPTY":"Potato","__EMPTY_1":"Late Blight"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"23","__EMPTY":"Potato","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"24","__EMPTY":"Raspberry","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"25","__EMPTY":"Soybean","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"26","__EMPTY":"Squash","__EMPTY_1":"Powdery Mildew"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"27","__EMPTY":"Strawberry","__EMPTY_1":"Leaf Scorch"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"28","__EMPTY":"Strawberry","__EMPTY_1":"Healthy"},{"PLANT  DISEASE  DETECTION":"29","__EMPTY":"Tomato","__EMPTY_1":"Early Blight ","__EMPTY_4":"i.
